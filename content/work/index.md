### "Moving Sound"

#### October 12, 2024
#### Second Saturdays are for Families @ Laguna Gloria

"Moving Sound" is a site specific, one-day interactive experience focusing on electronic & interactive sound technologies.

It will guide patrons through a multi-sensory experience, encouraging them to interact with live video feed that allows them to gesturally manipulate multiple elements of an ambient soundscape and music, in part referencing the works of Laurie Spiegel and Atau Tanaka.

### Chimera

[![Chimera WLD Event](squarepromoart.jpg "World Listening Day 2024")](https://worldlisteningday.org/events/chimera-world-listening-day-2024/)



#### July 18, 2024
#### Pease Park, Austin, TX

&nbsp;

Contributed piece: *Wales Countryside, Dusk*

In celebration of World Listening Day, July 18th, 2024 at 7pm, Collide Arts and Phonography Austin presented a sound installation, CHIMERA, in which field recordings were be played continuously throughout lower Pease Park. Artists were encouraged to submit field recordings that were made outside of the context of Pease Park – other biomes than Pease Park, from other seasons than summer, in other contexts than an urban park, in order to find out what happens when one soundscape is grafted onto another

Other contributing artists are Ann Armstrong, Henna Chou, Ara Herandez, Alex Keller, Steven N. Landry, Christopher McConnell, H. Montgomery, Alex Keller, and Josh Ronsen.

### "Hindsight" & Soundbath @ Tierras Sonidas

[![Tierras Sonidas](eva-poster-cropped.jpg)](https://www.sonicrodeo.org/)


#### May 25 - 26th, 2024
#### Marfa, TX

##### [Gallery](/TierrasSonidas)

In "Hindsight", Adam Hilton, Henna Chou and Laura Brackney sonically confronted the accumulation of memory as we age, and how our natural tendencies to look to our past for meaning only become more of a barrier to the present the older we get.

Tierras Sonidas Sonic Rodeo was a sound art festival that blossomed from desert visions during the opening performance of 'Not Flowers', a solo visual exhibition by Mo Eldridge at Do Right Hall in 2023. The event witnessed a convergence of sonic energy from Super Ethereal Champion World, Anthony Desimone, Veronica Anne Salinas, Liv Mershon, Eric Capper, and Mo Eldridge, each performing around a communal table to a packed audience. 

That energy was carried forward in 2024's event, which brought together emerging and established performers and artists from Texas, the Midwest, Oklahoma, and California. Set in the Marfa community, Tierras Sonidas celebrated sound art and experimental sounds inspired by the West Texas landscape.

### Forest Meditation

[![Elizabeth Chapin's Treespell](https://watw-media.storage.googleapis.com/wp-content/uploads/20240201160532/Treespell_51-1440x480.jpg)](https://womenandtheirwork.org/archive/forest-meditation/)

*In association with [Elizabeth Chapin’s ***Treespell***](https://womenandtheirwork.org/archive/elizabeth-chapin/)*
#### February 9, 2024
#### Women and Their Work Gallery

Hilton and Chou respond to Elizabeth Chapin’s Treespell exhibit, using electronic and acoustic sounds to engage the audience in a meditative environment.

**About Treepsell**: A commentary on today’s crowded visual culture and the growing sense of separation between humans and nature, Chapin’s work reflects and rejects the ways in which the modern world has turned away from nature and toward a constant influx of digital visual information. Treespell is an overarching story about this mutual spell that we’re all involved in; we become ‘beasted’ when we become separate from nature. Chapin’s colorful paintings of trees, which she approaches with the specific and thoughtful care usually reserved for portraiture, remind us of the value of returning our time, attention, and gaze back toward the natural world.

#### September 1-2 & 8-12, 2022
#### Rain Lily Farm | Austin, TX

Gentle our Driftless Caravan was a reverie contemplating bereavement, lassitude, and water— untenable to the experience— with its dichotomies as essence of life and a prevailing force of nature. Performed by dancers Alexa Capareda, Siri Cyan, Taryn Lavery, Clay Moore and Oddalys Salcido, with a live score by Henna Chou and Adam Hilton, set design by Ia Ensterä and lighting design by Natalie George Productions.

> “The score and choreography combine to suggest big emotions— separation, grief, love— and the farm setting roots the piece in a deep sense of place. It is spectacular and meditative, intimate and grand— triumphantly full of contradictions that work.” \- Courtney Thomas, [SIGHTLINES Magazine](https://sightlinesmag.org/seven-performance-highlights-of-2022)

Contributed piece: *I​-​35 at Lady Bird Lake, Summer*

Phonography Austin’s Fourth Annual Report is part of our ongoing program of educational workshops and listening experiences designed to foster artistic investigation of sound environments, acoustic phenomena and other aural situations through the practice of field recording.

The listener is encouraged to listen to the recordings presented as sound objects in and of themselves—or to embrace the sense of place and context as they occur in the recordings.
